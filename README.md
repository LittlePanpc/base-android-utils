base-android-utils
==================

This is a parent project as a library. It's a summary of my Android development experience. It concludes lots of tool classes, such as some classes about SharedPreference, IO, Download, Network and so on. Of course, some custom widgets, like RoundedImageView.

Usage:

1, set application of your project as BaseApp.
  set "android:name="com.yeepay.mobile.tv.base.BaseLenovoApp" in your <application .../>
2, set your Activity inherited from BaseActivity.
3, set your Fragment inherited from BaseFrag.
